- At the beginning LendingClub targeted small borrowers, $ 1,000 to $40,000 loans, and individual investors that can't conduct business with large banks.

- As FinTech company, the cost of infrastructure was much lower than large banks. Therefore, their service fee and profit was great compared to traditional lending market.

- In 2014 75% of the investors are individuals and that percentage have been fluctuating throughout the years.
